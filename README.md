# Augmentator

Augmentator is a ready-to-use tool for augmenting image datasets. With just a few clicks you could increase the size of your dataset without sacrificing it's quality.

> You choose your transformations, augmentator does the rest.

## Showcase

The design is very direct. Set the input directory and a place where you want to have the output. Select desired transformations and run the augmentation. Simple as that.

Hey, the tool has augmented all of the images and kept the directories structure! Even the images with modifications have added suffix that explains what happened. Nice...
